The Shell of the Future
Welcome to the future of shell programming! This project is designed to teach you the basics of shell programming in C, while also pushing the boundaries of what a shell can do. Our goal is to create a simple shell program that can execute basic commands and handle input and output, but with a twist.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to:

    Explain the design and implementation of the original Unix operating system, and how it has influenced modern computing
    Describe the first version of the UNIX shell and its creator, and how it has evolved over time
    Identify the inventor of the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language), and how it has impacted modern programming
    Explain who Ken Thompson is and his contributions to computer science, and how his work has influenced modern computing
    Describe how a shell works and the difference between a function and a system call, and how this knowledge can be applied to other programming languages
    Manipulate the environment of the current process and create new processes, and how this can be used to optimize system performance
    Understand the three prototypes of main and how the shell uses the PATH to find programs, and how this can be used to create more efficient and effective programs
    Execute another program with the execve system call and suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates, and how this can be used to create more complex and powerful programs
    Understand what EOF (end-of-file) is, and how it can be used to optimize file input and output
